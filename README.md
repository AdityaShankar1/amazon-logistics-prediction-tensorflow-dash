# Amazon Logistics Prediction with TensorFlow & Dash
<div align="center">
An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting Amazon delivery times with interactive analytics dashboard
</div>
🚀 Overview
This project implements a complete ML pipeline to predict delivery times for Amazon logistics using neural networks. Built with TensorFlow for model training and Dash for interactive visualization, it processes 43,000+ delivery records to identify key factors affecting delivery performance.
Key Features

Neural Network Regression - Custom TensorFlow/Keras model for delivery time prediction
Interactive Dashboard - Real-time data visualization with Plotly Dash
Feature Analysis - Correlation insights between delivery factors and performance
End-to-End Pipeline - From raw data preprocessing to web-based insights

📊 Dataset
Source: Amazon Delivery Dataset (43,000+ records)
Features:
